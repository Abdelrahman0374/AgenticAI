It can take inputs (arguments) and can return an output. Functions help in organizing code into reusable pieces.\\n\\n3. **Loop**: A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Common types of loops include for loops and while loops.\\n\\n4. **Array**: An array is a data structure that can hold a fixed number of values of a single type. It is used to store multiple items in a single variable, allowing for efficient data management and access.\\n\\nIf you need anything else, just let me know!\""
